Hello Server Admin! Thank you for purchasing WeaponMechanicsCosmetics!

I assume you're looking for the config files... Well, for organization's sake,
we decided that everything should be stored in the WeaponMechanics folder. This
allows all of your weapons to be put in 1 place. You can control a few options
in the config.yml file, but most of your time should be spent in the WeaponMechanics
folder.
